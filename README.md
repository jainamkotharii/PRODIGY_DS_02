# PRODIGY_DS_02
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

• Here's my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. For this task, I focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), delving into the provided dataset to gain a fundamental understanding of its characteristics. A key component of this involved crafting a visualization that clearly illustrates the distribution of a chosen variable.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is [Titanic DataSet](test.csv) which is uploaded in this repository. This dataset contains records of Passengers records, Their age, sex etc...

## Tools and Libraries used

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlip
4. Seaborn for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

My EDA process involved two key steps:

• Data Cleaning: I rigorously checked for and addressed missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure the dataset's integrity.

• Distribution Visualization: I generated various charts, including bar and stacked charts, to effectively illustrate the distributions of both categorical and continuous variables across the dataset.

## Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning task on the Titanic dataset has provided valuable insights into its structure and the relationships between various passenger attributes. Through rigorous cleaning, including handling missing values in 'Embarked', 'Cabin', and 'Age', and visualizing the distributions of key variables, a clearer understanding of the data's characteristics has been established.

Specifically, the visualization of selected variables effectively illustrated their distributions, revealing patterns such as the proportion of passengers in different classes, the survival rates across various demographics, and the distribution of passenger ages. These insights are crucial, as they form a robust foundation for subsequent analytical and predictive modeling efforts, such as predicting survival outcomes. The process of cleaning and visualizing has not only enhanced data integrity but also illuminated potential correlations and trends that will guide further investigation.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
